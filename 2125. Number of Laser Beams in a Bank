        //if in a row no device founf then currdevice = devices in a previous row

//For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.this means if there is no device b/w 2 diff rows then one divice in row can paas leaser beam to another row device. like if row0  having 3 device, row1 have no device and row2 have 2 device then beam can be passed from 3devices of row0 to 2 devices of row2. therefore 3*2 = 6 leaser beams
